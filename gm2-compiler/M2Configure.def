   Description: Exports configuration constants.
                Options that should not be overridden by users,
                therefore these are compiler compile time options.

(*
   PushParametersLeftToRight - if TRUE indicates that the parameters
                               are pushed in order from left to right.

                               are pushed in order from right to left.
*)

   PushParametersLeftToRight = TRUE ;


(*
   UseUnderscoreForC - if true then the C compiler uses _ in front of
                       all declarations.
*)

   (* we let gcc add _ to all identifiers otherwise we get two _ *)
   UseUnderscoreForC     = FALSE ;


(*
   UseDotForJumpLabels - if true then the C compiler produced .L2: for jump
                         labels. If false then the C compiler produced L2
*)

   UseDotForJumpLabels = FALSE ;


(*
   UsingGCCBackend - is the compiler being built with the GCC code generator?
*)
