   Log        : major overhaul of gm2, includes:
   Log        :   moving to a flat Makefile with few if any recusive makes
   Log        :   replaced many modules with their dynamic equivalent
   Log        :   using flex to build the lexical analyser
   Log        :   using ppg to build the top down recursive descent parser
   Log        :   many modifications to p2c to handle opaque types, sets
   Log        :   and forward references.
   Log        :   using new String library which removes any fixed size
   Log        :   character array limits.
   Log        :   using new M2Error library for all error handling
   Log        :   using new print style procedures rather than WriteString NumberIO
   Log        :   combination.
   Log        :   moving sources files into a new directory layout (no more symbolic
   Log        :   links will be used) - this reduces the build time and reduces
   Log        :   confusion.

(*
   CalculateFileName - calculates and returns a new string filename
                       given a module and an extension. This file name
                       length will be operating system specific.
                       String, Extension, is concatenated onto
                       Module and thus it is safe to `Mark' the extension
                       for garbage collection.

(*
   CalculateStemName - calculates the stem name for given a module.
                       This name length will be operating system and
      	       	       compiler specific.
