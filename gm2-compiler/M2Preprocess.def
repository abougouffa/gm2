(*
   PreprocessModule - preprocess a file, filename, returning the new filename
                      of the preprocessed file.
                      Preprocessing will only occur if requested by the user.
                      If no preprocessing was requested then filename is returned.
                      If preprocessing occurs then a temporary file is created
                      and its name is returned.
                      All temporary files will be deleted when the compiler exits.
