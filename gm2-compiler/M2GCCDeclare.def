(*
   DeclareConstant - declares a constant.

(*
   DeclareLocalVariables - lists the Local variables for procedure Sym
                           together with their offset.

   DeclareProcedure - declares procedure, sym, or all procedures inside

(*
   PoisonSymbols - poisons all gcc symbols from procedure, sym.
                   A debugging aid.

(*
   PromoteToString - declare, sym, and then promote it to a string.
                     Note that if sym is a single character we do *not* record it as a string
                          but as a char however we always return a string constant.

(*
   CompletelyResolved - returns TRUE if a symbol has been completely resolved
                        and is not partially declared (such as a record).

(*
   GetTypeMin - returns a symbol corresponding to MIN(type)
*)

PROCEDURE GetTypeMin (type: CARDINAL) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   GetTypeMax - returns a symbol corresponding to MAX(type)

(*
   InitDeclarations - initializes default types and the source filename.
