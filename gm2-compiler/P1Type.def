DEFINITION MODULE P1Type ;

   Author     : Gaius Mulley
   Title      : M2Type
   Date       : 3/4/87
   Description: Implements the type recording in the Modula-2 compiler.
                Enumeration types are built in Pass 1.
                Types are built in Pass 2 and ignored in Pass 3.

EXPORT QUALIFIED Type ;


(*
   Type - Parses a TYPE declaration during Pass1.
          In Pass 1 the Name of the type is passed on the stack,
          on returning the Name will be removed.
          The type name is removed since nothing is done with types during
          Pass 1. In Pass 2 a type is declared and placed into the parent
          scope, alternatively, if a variable is being declared,
          it is assigned to a variable and thus the name of the type is
          needed.
          However in Pass 1 only enumeration types are built,
          enumeration types are stored into the FifoQueue module waiting for
          Pass 2 to fully declare the type.
          Pass 1 does place the enumeration types into the main scope list.

          The Stack is expected:

          Entry                 Exit

   Ptr ->
          +------------+
          | Name       |        Empty
          |------------|

PROCEDURE Type () : BOOLEAN ;
