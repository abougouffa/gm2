    Description: provides an interface to GCC, essentially convert the
                 internal quadruples of m2f into a GCC tree structure.

(*
   InitGNUM2 - initializes the GCC SymbolTable with Modula-2 base types.
               Also initialize the start of quadruples.
*)

PROCEDURE InitGNUM2 (Head: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   ConvertQuadsToTree - runs through the quadruple list, Start..End, and converts it into
                        the GCC tree structure.
*)

PROCEDURE ConvertQuadsToTree (Start, End: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   ResolveConstantExpressions - resolves constant expressions from the quadruple list.
                                It returns TRUE if one or more constants were folded.
*)
