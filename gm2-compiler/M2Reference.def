   Description: Provides low level identifier referencing within
                quadruples and symbol table manipulation.
                Designator, Qualident and IdentList test whether the Auto ident
                push is on and only parses the source if it is off.

   Designator - returns true if a designator was found and
                if the Auto ident push flag is true then
                the Sym is altered to represent the Designator.

   Qualident - returns true if a Qualident was encountered.

               stack is altered.
