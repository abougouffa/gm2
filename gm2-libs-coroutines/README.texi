This directory contains a PIM SYSTEM containing the PROCESS primitives
built on top of GNU Pthreads. Currently this is work in progress and the code
is incomplete and full of bugs. It is not clear to me whether this approach
makes sense and therefore the status of this directory is just proof of concept.

The justification for this approach is that is provides a SYSTEM compatible with
Programming in Modula-2 and that higher level executives can be ported onto
GM2 with little effort. The disadvantage with this approach is that it introduces
slight inefficiency in that SYSTEM has to manipulate pth scheduling.
