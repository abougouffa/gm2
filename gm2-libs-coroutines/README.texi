This directory contains a PIM SYSTEM containing the PROCESS primitives
built on top of GNU Pthreads. 

The justification for this approach is that is provides a SYSTEM
compatible with Programming in Modula-2 [234] and the Logitech 3.0
compiler. It also allows higher level executives to be ported onto GM2
with little effort. The disadvantage with this approach is that
IOTRANSFER is not preemptive. IOTRANSFER will only context switch when
a call to LISTEN is made. In practice this limitation can be tolerated
as long as processes perform IO (or wait for a timer interrupt) the
idle process (in an executive) will call LISTEN and all should
work. But nevertheless a LOOP END will starve all other
processes. However the great advantage is that GNU Modula-2 can offer
users the ability to use IOTRANSFER, TRANSFER, NEWPROCESS in user
space on a multi-user operating system.

See the @file{examples/executive} directory for an executive and
timerhandler modules which provide higher level process creation,
synchronisation and interrupt handling routines.
