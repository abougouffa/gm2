DEFINITION MODULE FOR "C" cbuiltin ;

(*
    Title      : cbuiltin
    Author     : Gaius Mulley
    System     : GNU Modula-2
    Date       : Sat Jan  4 21:46:33 2003
    Revision   : $Version$ 
    Description: provides replacement routines in case the builtins are not used
                 by GNU Modula-2. This module is called by implementation modules
                 which implement builtins (see Builtins.mod for an example).
