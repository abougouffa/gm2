These libraries are based on the modules expressed in Programming in
Modula-2.  They include a number of alterations and a number of extra
libraries to allow access to compiler built-ins and underlying
operating system features. Perhaps the largest addition is the
@code{DynamicString} module which declares the type @code{String}
which results in a number of equivalent modules that can either handle
@code{ARRAY OF CHAR} or @code{String}.

These modules have been extensively tested and are used throughout
gm2.
