(*
   strtold - returns a LONGREAL given a C string, s.  It will set
             error to TRUE if the number is too large or badly formed.

(*
   ldtoa - converts a LONGREAL, d, into a string.  The address of the
           string is returned.
           mode       indicates the type of conversion required.
           ndigits    determines the number of digits according to mode.
