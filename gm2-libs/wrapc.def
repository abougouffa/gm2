(*
   strtime - returns the C string for the equivalent C asctime
             function.
*)

PROCEDURE strtime () : ADDRESS ;


(*
   filesize - assigns the size of a file, f, into low, high and
              returns zero if successful.
*)

PROCEDURE filesize (f: INTEGER; VAR low, high: CARDINAL) : INTEGER ;


(*
   filemtime - returns the mtime of a file, f.
*)

PROCEDURE filemtime (f: INTEGER) : INTEGER ;


(*
   getrand - returns a random number between 0..n-1
*)

PROCEDURE getrand (n: INTEGER) : INTEGER ;


(*
   getusername - returns a C string describing the current user.
*)

PROCEDURE getusername () : ADDRESS ;


(*
   getnameuidgid - fills in the, uid, and, gid, which represents
                   user, name.
*)

PROCEDURE getnameuidgid (name: ADDRESS; VAR uid, gid: INTEGER) ;


(*
   in C these procedure functions are really macros, so we provide
   real C functions and let gm2 call these if the builtins
   are unavailable.
