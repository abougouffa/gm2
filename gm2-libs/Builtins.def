    Revision   : $Version$ 
    Description: provides a convenient place to list all the GNU Modula-2
                 built-in functions. These functions should be copied into
                 more generic modules.

                 For example the mathematical functions can be applied to
                 gm2-iso/LongMath. But each built-in function is here for
                 reference.
