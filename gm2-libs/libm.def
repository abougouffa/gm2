    Revision   : $Version$ 
    Description: provides access to libm. Users are strongly advised to
                 use MathLib0 or RealMath as call to functions within
                 these modules will generate inline code. This module
                 is used by MathLib0 and RealMath when inline code cannot
                 be generated.
