DEFINITION MODULE cpp ;

(*
    Title      : cpp
    Author     : Gaius Mulley
    System     : GNU Modula-2

    Revision   : $Version$ 
    Description: provides an interface to cpp_test.
                 Notice we dont use FOR "C" in the header
                 section of the definition module as we fake
                 up a module in C++ which appears in object code
                 just like a Modula-2 module (even with the initialization
                 and finalization functions).  The DEFINITION MODULE FOR "C"
                 does not contain the initialization and finalization
                 functions.

PROCEDURE test ;

END cpp.
