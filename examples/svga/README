this example requires svgalib to be installed and also it requires
root permission to run.

The simple example draws a couple of logic gates and rotates and
transforms them around the screen. It uses 640x480x2 vgalib.  The
example uses a primitive vga.def definition, which provides gm2 with
very limited vgalib functionality.
