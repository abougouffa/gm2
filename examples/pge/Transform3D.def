FROM PolyMatrix3D IMPORT Matrix ;
FROM Fractions IMPORT Fract ;
FROM Points IMPORT Point ;

EXPORT QUALIFIED reflect, rotate, scale, translate ;


(*
   reflect - returns a Matrix representing the reflect
             transformation in line: y = mx + c.
*)

PROCEDURE reflect (m, x, c: Fract) : Matrix ;


(*
   rotate - returns a Matrix representing the rotate
            transformation about 0, 0 with r radians.
*)

PROCEDURE rotate (r: Fract) : Matrix ;


(*
   scale - returns a Matrix representing the scale
           transformation by vector, p.
*)

PROCEDURE scale (p: Point) : Matrix ;


(*
   translate - returns a Matrix representing the translate
               transformation by vector, p.
*)

PROCEDURE translate (p: Point) : Matrix ;


END Transform3D.
