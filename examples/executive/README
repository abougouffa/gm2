these two examples show that an executive and simple application code
can be built on top of the SYSTEM process primitives NEWPROCESS,
TRANSFER and IOTRANSFER. The Executive and TimerHandler have been
used in a stand alone microkernel for many years and have had
only minor alterations to make them work with the GNU/Linux SYSTEM.

The alterations were confined to:

  (*)  creating the clock interrupt vector (TimerHandler).
  (*)  using ListenLoop in Executive rather than LISTEN.
       LISTEN would work, but would be unkind to the
       underlying operating system. ListenLoop yields
       processor time back to the underlying OS via a
       blocking `pth_select'.
