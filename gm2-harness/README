gm2-harness is a simple package which allows you to rebuild gm2 from
source, run the regression tests and install the compiler.

To do this type:

./configure
make all
su
make install

The following configure options are implemented:

   --with-gdb         builds gdb-6.6 (which has Modula-2 language support)
   --with-cvs         forces `make' to download the latest cvs from the cvs server
   --with-gcc=4.1.2   grafts GNU Modula-2 onto the gcc-4.1.2 release
   --disable-ulmlib   disables building and installing the ulm libraries
   --enable-ulmlib    enables building and installing the ulm libraries
   
Your system C compiler and associated tools will need to be able to
build the C compiler from the gcc version requested.
