DEFINITION MODULE LongConv;

  (* Low-level LONGREAL/string conversions *)

IMPORT
  ConvTypes;

TYPE
  ConvResults = ConvTypes.ConvResults; (* strAllRight, strOutOfRange, strWrongFormat, strEmpty *)

PROCEDURE ScanReal (inputCh: CHAR; VAR chClass: ConvTypes.ScanClass;
                    VAR nextState: ConvTypes.ScanState);
  (* Represents the start state of a finite state scanner for real numbers - assigns
     class of inputCh to chClass and a procedure representing the next state to
     nextState.
  *)

PROCEDURE FormatReal (str: ARRAY OF CHAR): ConvResults;
  (* Returns the format of the string value for conversion to LONGREAL. *)

PROCEDURE ValueReal (str: ARRAY OF CHAR): LONGREAL;
  (* Returns the value corresponding to the real number string value str if str is
     well-formed; otherwise raises the LongConv exception.
  *)

PROCEDURE LengthFloatReal (real: LONGREAL; sigFigs: CARDINAL): CARDINAL;
  (* Returns the number of characters in the floating-point string representation of
     real with sigFigs significant figures.
  *)

PROCEDURE LengthEngReal (real: LONGREAL; sigFigs: CARDINAL): CARDINAL;
  (* Returns the number of characters in the floating-point engineering string
     representation of real with sigFigs significant figures.
  *)

PROCEDURE LengthFixedReal (real: LONGREAL; place: INTEGER): CARDINAL;
  (* Returns the number of characters in the fixed-point string representation of real
     rounded to the given place relative to the decimal point.
  *)

PROCEDURE IsRConvException (): BOOLEAN;
  (* Returns TRUE if the current coroutine is in the exceptional execution state because
     of the raising of an exception in a routine from this module; otherwise returns
     FALSE.
