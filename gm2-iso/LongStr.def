DEFINITION MODULE LongStr;

  (* LONGREAL/string conversions *)

IMPORT
  ConvTypes;

TYPE
  ConvResults = ConvTypes.ConvResults; (* strAllRight, strOutOfRange, strWrongFormat, strEmpty *)

(* the string form of a signed fixed-point real number is
     ["+" | "-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit}, [".", {decimal digit}]
*)

(* the string form of a signed floating-point real number is
     signed fixed-point real number, "E", ["+" | "-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit}
*)

PROCEDURE StrToReal (str: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR real: LONGREAL; VAR res: ConvResults);
  (* Ignores any leading spaces in str. If the subsequent characters in str are in the
     format of a signed real number, assigns a corresponding value to real.
     Assigns a value indicating the format of str to res.
  *)

PROCEDURE RealToFloat (real: LONGREAL; sigFigs: CARDINAL; VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  (* Converts the value of real to floating-point string form, with sigFigs significant
     figures, and copies the possibly truncated result to str.
  *)

PROCEDURE RealToEng (real: LONGREAL; sigFigs: CARDINAL; VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  (* Converts the value of real to floating-point string form, with sigFigs significant
     figures, and copies the possibly truncated result to str. The number is scaled with
     one to three digits in the whole number part and with an exponent that is a
     multiple of three.
  *)

PROCEDURE RealToFixed (real: LONGREAL; place: INTEGER; VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  (* Converts the value of real to fixed-point string form, rounded to the given place
     relative to the decimal point, and copies the possibly truncated result to str.
  *)

PROCEDURE RealToStr (real: LONGREAL; VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  (* Converts the value of real as RealToFixed if the sign and magnitude can be shown
     within the capacity of str, or otherwise as RealToFloat, and copies the possibly
     truncated result to str. The number of places or significant digits depend on the
     capacity of str.

END LongStr.
