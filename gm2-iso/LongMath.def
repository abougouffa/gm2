PROCEDURE __BUILTIN__ sqrt (x: LONGREAL): LONGREAL;
  (* Returns the positive square root of x *)

PROCEDURE exp (x: LONGREAL): LONGREAL;
  (* Returns the exponential of x *)

PROCEDURE ln (x: LONGREAL): LONGREAL;
  (* Returns the natural logarithm of x *)

  (* The angle in all trigonometric functions is measured in radians *)

PROCEDURE __BUILTIN__ sin (x: LONGREAL): LONGREAL;
  (* Returns the sine of x *)

PROCEDURE __BUILTIN__ cos (x: LONGREAL): LONGREAL;
  (* Returns the cosine of x *)

PROCEDURE tan (x: LONGREAL): LONGREAL;

PROCEDURE round (x: LONGREAL): INTEGER;
  (* Returns the value of x rounded to the nearest integer *)

PROCEDURE IsRMathException (): BOOLEAN;
  (* Returns TRUE if the current coroutine is in the exceptional execution state
     because of the raising of an exception in a routine from this module; otherwise
     returns FALSE.
  *)
