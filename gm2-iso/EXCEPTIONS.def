DEFINITION MODULE EXCEPTIONS;

(* Provides facilities for raising user exceptions
   and for making enquiries concerning the current execution state.
*)

TYPE
  ExceptionSource;                (* values of this type are used within library modules to
                                     identify the source of raised exceptions
 *)
  ExceptionNumber = CARDINAL;

PROCEDURE AllocateSource(VAR newSource: ExceptionSource);
  (* Allocates a unique value of type ExceptionSource *)

PROCEDURE RAISE (source: ExceptionSource; number: ExceptionNumber; message: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  (* Associates the given values of source, number and message with the current context
     and raises an exception.
  *)

PROCEDURE CurrentNumber (source: ExceptionSource): ExceptionNumber;
  (* If the current coroutine is in the exceptional execution state because of the raising
     of an exception from source, returns the corresponding number, and otherwise
     raises an exception.
  *)

PROCEDURE GetMessage (VAR text: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  (* If the current coroutine is in the exceptional execution state, returns the possibly
     truncated string associated with the current context.
     Otherwise, in normal execution state, returns the empty string.
  *)

PROCEDURE IsCurrentSource (source: ExceptionSource): BOOLEAN;
  (* If the current coroutine is in the exceptional execution state because of the raising
     of an exception from source, returns TRUE, and otherwise returns FALSE.
  *)

PROCEDURE IsExceptionalExecution (): BOOLEAN;
  (* If the current coroutine is in the exceptional execution state because of the raising
     of an exception, returns TRUE, and otherwise returns FALSE.
