IMPORT

TYPE

(* the string form of a signed whole number is
     ["+" | "-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit}
*)

PROCEDURE StrToInt (str: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR int: INTEGER; VAR res: ConvResults);
  (* Ignores any leading spaces in str. If the subsequent characters in str are in the
     format of a signed whole number, assigns a corresponding value to int. Assigns a
     value indicating the format of str to res.

PROCEDURE IntToStr (int: INTEGER; VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  (* Converts the value of int to string form and copies the possibly truncated result to str. *)

(* the string form of an unsigned whole number is
     decimal digit, {decimal digit}

PROCEDURE StrToCard (str: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR card: CARDINAL; VAR res: ConvResults);
  (* Ignores any leading spaces in str. If the subsequent characters in str are in the
     format of an unsigned whole number, assigns a corresponding value to card.
