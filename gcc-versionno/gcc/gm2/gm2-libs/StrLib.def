(*
   StrConCat - combines a and b into c.
*)

PROCEDURE StrConCat (a, b: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR c: ARRAY OF CHAR) ;


(*
   StrLess - returns TRUE if string, a, alphabetically occurs before
             string, b.
*)

PROCEDURE StrLess (a, b: ARRAY OF CHAR) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   StrEqual - performs a = b on two strings.
*)

PROCEDURE StrEqual (a, b: ARRAY OF CHAR) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   StrLen - returns the length of string, a.
*)

PROCEDURE StrLen (a: ARRAY OF CHAR) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   StrCopy - effectively performs b := a with two strings.
*)

PROCEDURE StrCopy (a: ARRAY OF CHAR ; VAR b: ARRAY OF CHAR) ;


(*
   IsSubString - returns true if b is a subcomponent of a.
*)

PROCEDURE IsSubString (a, b: ARRAY OF CHAR) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   StrRemoveWhitePrefix - copies string, into string, b, excluding any white
                          space infront of a.
