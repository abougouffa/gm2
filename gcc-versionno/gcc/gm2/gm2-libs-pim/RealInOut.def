(*
   SetNoOfDecimalPlaces - number of decimal places WriteReal and
                          WriteLongReal should emit.  This procedure
                          can be used to override the default
                          DefaultDecimalPlaces constant.

PROCEDURE SetNoOfDecimalPlaces (places: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   ReadReal - reads a real number, legal syntaxes include:
              100, 100.0, 100e0, 100E0, 100E-1, E2, +1E+2, 1e+2
*)

PROCEDURE ReadReal (VAR x: REAL) ;


(*
   WriteReal - writes a real to the terminal. The real number
               is right justified and, n, is the minimum field
               width.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteReal (x: REAL; n: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   WriteRealOct - writes the real to terminal in octal words.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteRealOct (x: REAL) ;


(*
   ReadLongReal - reads a LONGREAL number, legal syntaxes include:
                  100, 100.0, 100e0, 100E0, 100E-1, E2, +1E+2, 1e+2
*)

PROCEDURE ReadLongReal (VAR x: LONGREAL) ;


(*
   WriteLongReal - writes a LONGREAL to the terminal. The real number
                   is right justified and, n, is the minimum field
                   width.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteLongReal (x: LONGREAL; n: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   WriteLongRealOct - writes the LONGREAL to terminal in octal words.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteLongRealOct (x: LONGREAL) ;


(*
   ReadShortReal - reads a SHORTREAL number, legal syntaxes include:
                   100, 100.0, 100e0, 100E0, 100E-1, E2, +1E+2, 1e+2
*)

PROCEDURE ReadShortReal (VAR x: SHORTREAL) ;


(*
   WriteShortReal - writes a SHORTREAL to the terminal. The real number
                    is right justified and, n, is the minimum field
                    width.

PROCEDURE WriteShortReal (x: SHORTREAL; n: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   WriteShortRealOct - writes the SHORTREAL to terminal in octal words.
