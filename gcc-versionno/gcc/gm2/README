Getting GNU Modula-2
====================

Two options, either get download a copy of gcc+gm2 in a large tarball
or checkout the development sources.  Please be aware that gm2 is in
development and might fail to compile with the current version of gcc.
Obtaining a tarball is advisable if you just want a ready made gm2 and
gcc combination.

Tarballs
========

The latest git snapshot and combined gcc can be obtained from:
http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/download/c/gcc-4.7.3+gm2-git-latest.tar.gz
There are also older snapshots available from
http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/download/c.

Building GNU Modula-2
=====================

To build gm2 type:

   mkdir host-build
   cd host-build
   CFLAGS="-g $PROFILE" ../combined/gm2/gcc-versionno/configure \
    --prefix=$HOME/opt \
    --libexecdir=$HOME/opt/lib \
    --disable-shared \
    --enable-threads=posix \
    --enable-clocale=gnu --enable-languages=c,gm2 \
    --disable-multilib --disable-bootstrap --enable-checking
   make
   cd ..

Installing GNU Modula-2

   su
   cd host-build
   make install
   cd ..

A simple test
=============

Now you should be able to perform:

   PATH=$HOME/opt/bin:$PATH
   export PATH
   cd host-build/gcc/gm2/examples/hello
   make post-install

this should result in creating an a.out for the infamous hello world
example.  The directory $HOME/opt may be moved to a more public place
and provided your PATH is altered appropriately (to reference the bin
directory) all the libraries and subcomponents of GNU Modula-2 will be
found.

Stress testing GM2
==================

   cd host-build/gcc ; make gm2.paranoid

which builds gm2 using itself and then compiles each module
with both versions of gm2 comparing the emitted assembler code.
