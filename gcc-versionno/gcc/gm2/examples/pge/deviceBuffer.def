(*
   configDevice - configure the output device to have outMax resolution and
                  a buffer.
*)

PROCEDURE configDevice (inMax, outMax: Point; buffer: ADDRESS; length: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   white - returns the colour, white.
*)

PROCEDURE white () : CARDINAL ;


(*
   black - returns the colour, black.
*)

PROCEDURE black () : CARDINAL ;


(*
   red - returns the colour, red.
*)

PROCEDURE red () : CARDINAL ;


(*
   green - returns the colour, green.
*)

PROCEDURE green () : CARDINAL ;


(*
   blue - returns the colour, blue.
*)

PROCEDURE blue () : CARDINAL ;


(*
   yellow - returns the colour, yellow.
*)

PROCEDURE yellow () : CARDINAL ;


(*
   purple - returns the colour, purple.
*)

PROCEDURE purple () : CARDINAL ;


(*
   glyphLine - draw a line between:  start and end of, thick, thickness and colour, c.
*)

PROCEDURE glyphLine (start, end: Point; thick: Fract; c: Colour) ;


(*
   glyphPolygon - draw a polygon given n absolute points.
                  If fill then it is filled with colour, c, else it is drawn with
                  thickness in outline using colour, c.
*)

PROCEDURE glyphPolygon (n: CARDINAL; p: ARRAY OF Point; fill: BOOLEAN; thick: Fract; c: Colour) ;


(*
   glyphCircle - draw a circle at point, pos.  If fill then it is filled by colour, c,
                 otherwise it is drawn in outline with a thickness, thick, in colour, c.
*)

PROCEDURE glyphCircle (pos: Point; fill: BOOLEAN; thick: Fract; rad: Fract; c: Colour) ;


(*
   flipBuffer - renders the current buffer and then sets up a new buffer to be
                populated by new glyphs.
*)

PROCEDURE flipBuffer ;


(*
   defineColour - defines a colour by: r, g, b.  The fracts
                  are given to the colour and a colour index
                  is returned.  Colours live for ever and are
                  never freed.

   Init - initialise this module.
