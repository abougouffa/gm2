(*
   yellow - returns the colour, yellow.

   purple - returns the colour, purple.

PROCEDURE purple () : CARDINAL ;


(*
   glyphLine - draw a line between:  start and end of, thick, thickness and colour, c.
*)

PROCEDURE glyphLine (start, end: Point; thick: Fract; c: Colour) ;


(*
   glyphPolygon - draw a polygon given n absolute points.
                  If fill then it is filled with colour, c, else it is drawn with
                  thickness in outline using colour, c.
*)

PROCEDURE glyphPolygon (n: CARDINAL; p: ARRAY OF Point; fill: BOOLEAN; thick: Fract; c: Colour) ;


(*
   glyphCircle - draw a circle at point, pos.  If fill then it is filled by colour, c,
                 otherwise it is drawn in outline with a thickness, thick, in colour, c.
*)

PROCEDURE glyphCircle (pos: Point; fill: BOOLEAN; thick: Fract; rad: Fract; c: Colour) ;


(*
   flipBuffer - renders the current buffer and then sets up a new buffer to be
                populated by new glyphs.
*)

PROCEDURE flipBuffer ;


(*
   frameNote - emit a note to indicate a new frame has commenced.
*)

PROCEDURE frameNote ;


(*
   emptyCbuffer - empty the colour buffer (this only applies if the module is using
                  the buffer device).
*)

(*
   emptyFbuffer - empty the frame buffer (this only applies if the module is using
                  the buffer device).

(*
   writeTime - writes the delay, t, to the frame buffer (if t > 0.0).
*)

(*
   defineColour - defines a colour by: r, g, b.  The fracts
                  are given to the colour and a colour index
                  is returned.  Colours live for ever and are
                  never freed.

(*
   useRPC - make rpc's to the pygame display server to render frames.
*)

PROCEDURE useRPC ;


(*
   finish - close the device file.
*)

PROCEDURE finish ;


(*
   configDevice - configure the output device to have outMax resolution.
*)

   getFrameBuffer - collects the frame buffer limits in the following parameters.
