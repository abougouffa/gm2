   Description: Exports configuration constants.
                Options that should not be overridden by users,
                therefore these are compiler compile time options.

(*
   UseUnderscoreForC - if true then the C compiler uses _ in front of

(*
   UsingGCCBackend - is the compiler being built with the GCC code generator?
