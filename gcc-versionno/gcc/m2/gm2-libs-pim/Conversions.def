   ConvertOctal - converts a CARDINAL, num, into an octal/hex/decimal
                  string and right justifies the string. It adds
                  spaces rather than '0' to pad out the string
                  to len characters.

                  If the length of str is < num then the number is
                  truncated on the right.
