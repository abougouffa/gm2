DEFINITION MODULE gdbif ;

(*  Provides interactive connectivity with gdb useful for debugging
    Modula-2 shared libraries.  *)

EXPORT UNQUALIFIED sleepSpin, finishSpin, connectSpin ;


(*
   finishSpin - sets boolean mustWait to FALSE.
*)

PROCEDURE finishSpin ;


(*
   sleepSpin - waits for the boolean variable mustWait to become FALSE.
               It sleeps for a second between each test of the variable.
*)

PROCEDURE sleepSpin ;


(*
   connectSpin - breakpoint placeholder.  Its only purpose is to allow users
                 to set a breakpoint.  This procedure is called once
                 sleepSpin is released from its spin (via a call from
                 finishSpin).
*)

PROCEDURE connectSpin ;


END gdbif.
