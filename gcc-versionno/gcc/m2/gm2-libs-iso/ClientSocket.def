DEFINITION MODULE ClientSocket ;

FROM IOChan IMPORT ChanId ;
FROM ChanConsts IMPORT FlagSet, OpenResults ;


(*
   OpenSocket - opens a TCP client connection to host:port.
*)

PROCEDURE OpenSocket (VAR cid: ChanId;
                      host: ARRAY OF CHAR; port: CARDINAL;
                      f: FlagSet; VAR res: OpenResults) ;

(*
   Close - if the channel identified by cid is not open to
           a socket stream, the exception wrongDevice is
           raised; otherwise closes the channel, and assigns
           the value identifying the invalid channel to cid.
*)

PROCEDURE Close (VAR cid: ChanId) ;


(*
   IsSocket - tests if the channel identified by cid is open as
              a client socket stream.

PROCEDURE IsSocket (cid: ChanId) : BOOLEAN ;


END ClientSocket.
