The directory structure of gcc-versionno, follows the directory
structure of a gcc release and is intended to be overlayed ontop of a
gcc release together with a few patches for gcc.  For more details see
the gm2 documentation gcc-versionno/gcc/gm2/gm2.texi and also the
script gm2-harness/shell-bin/produce-gcc-gm2-tree.
