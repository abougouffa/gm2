Warning

This code is currently in development, it is very incomplete &
highly likely to create massive core dumps. Patches and
development volunteers highly welcome! See contributions at

Please see the gm2.texi file for furthur info

Getting GNU Modula-2
====================

To get GM2 type the following:

   export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk:/usr/src/cvs
   cvs login
   cvs -z9 checkout GM2

this will checkout a copy of GNU Modula-2
into one subdirectory: gm2

This (very development, very incomplete, very buggy, highly unstable)
version of GM2 needs to be placed inside an egcs directory tree in
the position egcs-version/gcc before GNU Modula-2 can be built.

Assuming that both egcs and gm2 are at the same directory level, type:
   
   mv gm2 egcs-20000103/gcc

From now on egcs-20000103 will be called egcs-version for simplicity.
The gm2.texi file outlines the strategy for generating gm2 from the
m2f source tree. The gm2.texi file also describes the history of m2f.

You can get egcs-20000103 from my machine
ftp://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/pub/c but be warned it is large
(approximately 14 MB). Originally I had gcc-2.8.1 checked into the cvs
source tree together with GM2, but since egcs has grown in size and so
far GM2 has *not* modified egcs in any way I've separated the two.
You might already have a copy of egcs and if you're a modem user you
might be very glad of this :-)

Building GNU Modula-2
=====================

To build gm2 type:
   cd egcs-version ; ./configure ; make info ; make dvi
   (ignore any error associated with making java.dvi..)
   cd gcc ; make c xgcc gm2

A simple test
=============

you should be able to perform:

   ./xgm2 -B./x -S -g -c -Igm2/m2/comp/libs -Igm2/m2/comp/autotest/gm2 gm2/m2/comp/autotest/gm2/foo.mod

Building m2f
============

To build the original m2f without gcc codegenerator type:

   cd egcs-version/gcc/gm2/m2/comp ; make clean reconfig ; make all

Note that you have to be on a [3456]86 Linux box to do this.
It will generate a [34]86 & 586 codegenerator and an x86 tiny
model codegenerator.

To install m2f type:

   su
   make install
