Warning
=======

This code is currently in development, it is very incomplete &
highly likely to create massive core dumps. Patches and
development volunteers highly welcome! See contributions at
the bottom of this file.

Please see the gm2.texi file for furthur info

Getting GNU Modula-2
====================

Two options, either get download a copy of gcc+gm2 in a large tarball
or checkout the development sources.  Please be aware that gm2 is in
development and might fail to compile with the current version of gcc.

Cutting edge development sources
================================

To get the latest sources to GM2 type the following:

   export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk:/usr/src/cvs
   cvs login
   cvs -z9 checkout GM2

(note the capital GM2 in the checkout, GM2 is the project module within cvs).
This will checkout a copy of GNU Modula-2 into one subdirectory: gm2

This (very development, very buggy, highly unstable)
version of GM2 needs to be placed inside an GCC directory tree in
the position egcs-version/gcc before GNU Modula-2 can be built.

Assuming that both GCC and gm2 are at the same directory level, type:
   
   mv gm2 egcs-version/gcc

The gm2.texi file outlines the strategy for generating gm2 from the
m2f source tree. The gm2.texi file also describes the history of m2f.

Tarballs
========

see ftp://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/pub/c
for files which look like gm2+egcs-version.tar.gz.
The tarballs will have the modifications outlined below applied.

Modifications to gcc
====================

in gcc/ggc-page.c:

void
ggc_collect ()
{
#if defined(GM2)
  return;  /* don't garbage collect when building gm2 - this
            * is an ugly hack which will be removed r.s.n
            */
#endif
 etc etc


Building GNU Modula-2
=====================

To build gm2 type:
   cd egcs-version ; ./configure ; make

A simple test
=============

you should be able to perform:

compile
   ./xgm2 -B./x -c -g -Igm2/gm2-libs -Igm2/m2/comp/libs gm2/m2/comp/libs/hello.mod
link
   ./xgm2 -B./x -g -Igm2/gm2-libs -Igm2/m2/comp/libs gm2/m2/comp/libs/hello.mod

this should result in creating an a.out for the infamous hello world example.

Building m2f
============

To build the original m2f without gcc codegenerator type:

   cd egcs-version/gcc/gm2/m2/comp ; make clean reconfig ; make all

Note that you have to be on a [3456]86 GNU/Linux box to do this.
It will generate a [345]86 codegenerator and an x86 tiny
model codegenerator.

To install m2f type:

   su
   make install
