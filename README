This is the top level directory of the project GNU Modula-2.

The GNU Modula-2 source is found under gcc-versionno, whereas utility
scripts for building tarballs are found under gm2-harness.

The directory structure of gcc-versionno, follows the directory
structure of a gcc release and is intended to be overlayed ontop of a
gcc release together with a few patches for gcc.  For more details see
the gm2 documentation gcc-versionno/gcc/gm2/gm2.texi and also the
script gm2-harness/shell-bin/produce-gcc-gm2-tree.

Or to cut to the chase, type:

$ sh ./combine-trees

which will produce a source tree in ./scratch/sources/gm2/gcc-versionno


Git Source Tree Layout
======================

Here is a diagram summarising the layout of this source tree

             +------[gm2]----------+---------+
            /         |             \         \
           /          |              \         \
[gm2-harness]   [gcc-versionno]   README   combine-trees
   |             /    |
   |            /     |
  "etc"    [libgm2] [gcc]--------------+
                      |                 \
                      |                  \
                    [gm2]             [testsuite]
                     /  \                  \
                    /    \                  \
  "etc"    [gm2-libs]    [gm2-compiler]    [gm2]




This tree should be overlayed on top of a gcc source tree which in
summary looks like this:


                 [gcc-4.7.3]
                      |
                      |
                +---[gcc]----+
               /      |       \
              /       |        \
     [fortran]    [c-family]    [testsuite]-------+
                                 \                 \
                                  \                 \
                                  [c-c++-common]    [lib]
