Please see the gm2.texi file for furthur info

Getting GNU Modula-2
====================

To get GM2 type the following:

   export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk:/usr/src/cvs
   cvs login
   cvs -z9 checkout GM2

this will checkout a copy of egcs + GM2
into two subdirectories: egcs-version and gm2

The gm2 directory needs to be placed inside the egcs directory
before GNU Modula-2 can be built. To do this type (assuming
you are currently above both of these directories)
   
   mv gm2 egcs-20000103/gcc

From now on egcs-20000103 will be called egcs-version for simplicity.
The gm2.texi file outlines the strategy for generating gm2 from the
m2f source tree. The gm2.texi file also describes the history of m2f.

Building GNU Modula-2
=====================

To build gm2 type:
   cd egcs-version ; ./configure ; make info ; make dvi ; make c xgcc
   cd gcc ; make gm2

on a x86 Linux system continue with:

   cd gm2/m2/comp
   make libs

A simple test
=============

you should be able to perform:

   ./xgcc -B./x -S -g -c -Igm2/m2/comp/libs foo.mod

Building m2f
============

To build the original m2f without gcc codegenerator type:

   cd egcs-version/gcc/m2/comp ; make clean reconfig ; make all

Note that you have to be on a [3456]86 Linux box to do this.
It will generate a [34]86 & 586 codegenerator and an x86 tiny
model codegenerator.

To install m2f type:

   su
   make install
