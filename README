Warning

This code is currently in development, it is not yet complete and highly
likely to create massive core dumps. Patches and development
volunteers highly welcome! See contributions at the bottom of this

Please see the gm2.texi file for furthur info

Getting GNU Modula-2
====================

Two options, either get download a copy of gcc+gm2 in a large tarball
or checkout the development sources.  Please be aware that gm2 is in
development and might fail to compile with the current version of gcc.

Development sources
===================

To get the latest sources to GM2 type the following:

   export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk:/usr/src/cvs
   cvs login
   cvs -z9 checkout GM2

(note the capital GM2 in the checkout, GM2 is the project module within cvs).
This will checkout a copy of GNU Modula-2 into one subdirectory: gm2

This version of GM2 needs to be placed inside an GCC directory tree in
the position gcc-version/gcc before GNU Modula-2 can be built.

Assuming that both GCC and gm2 are at the same directory level, type:
   
   mv gm2 gcc-version/gcc

Tarballs
========

see ftp://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/pub/c
for files which look like gm2+gcc-version.tar.gz.

Building GNU Modula-2
=====================

To build gm2 type:
   cd gcc-version ; ./configure ; make

Installing GNU Modula-2

   cd gcc-version/gcc ; make install

A simple test
=============

you should be able to perform:

   cd gcc-version/gcc/gm2/examples/hello
   make

this should result in creating an a.out for the infamous hello world example.

Stress testing GM2
==================

   cd gcc-version/gcc/gm2 ; make paranoid

which builds gm2 using itself and then compiles each module
with both versions of gm2 comparing the emitted assembler code.
