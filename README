This directory should be called gm2 and should be situated inside
the gcc source release (ie gcc-2.8.1/gm2)

The DESIGN file outlines the strategy for generating gm2 from the
m2f source tree. The DESIGN file also describes the history of m2f.

Building gm2 (GNU Modula-2)
===========================

To build gm2 type:
   cd .. ; make gm2

Building m2f
============

To build the original m2f without gcc codegenerator type:
   cd m2/comp ; make all

Note that you have to be on a [3456]86 Linux box to do this.
It will generate a [34]86 & 586 codegenerator and an x86 tiny
model codegenerator.

To install m2f type:

   su
   make install
