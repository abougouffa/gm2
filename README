Getting GNU Modula-2
====================

To get GM2 type the following:

   export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk:/usr/src/cvs
   cvs login
   cvs -z9 checkout GM2

this will checkout a slightly modified gcc-2.8.1 + GM2
into two subdirectories: gcc-2.8.1 and gm2

The gm2 directory needs to be placed inside gcc-2.8.1 before
GNU Modula-2 can be build. To do this type (assuming you are
currently above both of these directories)
   
   mv gm2 gcc-2.8.1

The DESIGN file outlines the strategy for generating gm2 from the
m2f source tree. The DESIGN file also describes the history of m2f.

Building GNU Modula-2
=====================

To build gm2 type:
   cd gcc-2.8.1 ; make gm2

A simple test
=============

you should be able to perform:

   ./xgm2 -S -g -c -Igm2/m2/comp/libs foo.mod

Building m2f
============

To build the original m2f without gcc codegenerator type:
   cd gcc-2.8.1/m2/comp ; make all

Note that you have to be on a [3456]86 Linux box to do this.
It will generate a [34]86 & 586 codegenerator and an x86 tiny
model codegenerator.

To install m2f type:

   su
   make install
