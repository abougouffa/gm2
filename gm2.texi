@section About

This file contains design notes accompanying the Modula-2
front end to gcc. The GNU Modula-2 compiler is based on
the language as defined in 'Programming in Modula-2'
2nd Edition, Springer Verlag, 1982, 1983 by Niklaus Wirth.
(PIM2).
Although it does include minor extensions.

The libraries are currently a mixture of ISO Modula-2 and
'Programming in Modula-2'. It is our aim to extend the
GNU Modula-2 to include PIM3 and PIM4 compatability.

@node Compiler options, Example usage, About, Using
@section Compiler options

This section describe the compiler options specific to GNU Modula-2 for
generic flags details see
@xref{Invoking GCC, , ,gcc}.

@table @code

@item -Wbounds
generate code to check the bounds of subranges and array indexes.

@item -Wreturn
generate code to check that functions always exit with a @samp{RETURN} and do not
fall out at the end.

@item -verbose
if an error occurs the erroneous text is displayed with an arrow indicating
the approximate character in error.
The line number and file is always displayed, but sometimes the compiler
attributes the error to the following line.
The @samp{-verbose} option is more accurate and more verbose!

@item -Wstatistics
generates quadruple information: number of quadruples generated,
number of quadruples remaining after optimization.

@item -Wstudents
checks for bad programming style. This option is aimed at
new users of Modula-2 in that it checks for situations which
might cause confusion and thus mistakes.
It checks whether variables of the same name are declared in
different scopes and whether variables look like keywords.
Experienced users might find this option too agressive.

@item -Wpedantic
forces the compiler to reject nested @samp{WITH}
statements referencing the same record type.
Does not allow multiple imports of the same item from a module.
It also checks that: procedure variables are written to before being read;
variables are not only written to but read from; variables are declared and used.
If the compiler encounters a variable being read before written it will terminate
with a message.
It will check that @samp{FOR} loop indices are not used outside the end of this loop
without being reset.

@item -Wmakelist
this option is only applicable when linking a program module.
The compiler will generate a @file{modulename.lst} file which contains
a list indicating the initialization order of all modules which are to be
linked. The actual link does not occur.
The gm2 linker scans all @code{IMPORT}s, generates a list of dependancies
and produces an ordered list for initialization. It will probably get the
order wrong if your project has cyclic dependancies, but
the @file{.lst} file is plain text and can be modified if required.
Once the @file{.lst} file is created it can be used by the compiler
to link your project via the @samp{-Wuselist} option.
It has no effect if the @samp{-c} option is present.

@item -Wuselist
providing @samp{gm2} has been told to link the program module this
option uses the file @file{modulename.lst} for the initialization
order of modules.

@item -Wcpp
do preprocess the source with @samp{cpp -traditional -lang-asm -C}
For further details about these options see
@xref{Invocation, , ,cpp}.

@end table

@node Example usage, Extensions, Compiler options, Using
@section Example compile and link

This section describes how to compiler and link a simple hello world program.
It provides a few examples of using the different options mentioned in
@xref{Compiler options, , ,gm2}.
Assuming that you have a file called @file{hello.mod} in your current directory
which contains:

@example
MODULE hello ;

FROM StrIO IMPORT WriteString, WriteLn ;

BEGIN
   WriteString('hello world') ; WriteLn
END hello.
@end example

You should be able to compile it by:
@samp{gm2 -c -g hello.mod}
and link via:
@samp{gm2 -g hello.mod}.
The result should be an @samp{a.out} file created in your directory.
Hint, the
@samp{-v} displays the subprocesses initiated by
@samp{gm2}.
This can be useful when trouble shooting.

@node Extensions, Interface to C, Example usage, Using
@section GNU Modula-2 language extensions

This section introduces the GNU Modula-2 language extensions.
The GNU Modula-2 compiler allows abstract data types to be
@code{any} type, not just restricted to a pointer type.

It also allows declarations in any order. Type, constant, procedure and
variable declarations can be in any order. Nested modules may also declare
types in any order, consider:

@example
MODULE colour ;

   PROCEDURE make (VAR c: colours) ;
   BEGIN
      c := yellow
   END make ;

   MODULE inner ;
   EXPORT colours ;

   TYPE
      colours = (red, blue, yellow, white) ;
   END inner ;

VAR
   g: colours
BEGIN
   make(g)
END colour.
@end example

The preprocessor @samp{cpp} can be invoked via the @samp{-Wcpp} command
line option. This in turn invokes @samp{cpp} with the following
arguments @samp{-traditional -lang-asm -C}.
These options preserve comments and all quotations.
The preprocessor character @samp{#} must be in the first
column.

@node Interface to C, Assembly language, Extensions, Using
@section Interfacing GNU Modula-2 to C

The GNU Modula-2 compiler tries to use the C calling convention wherever
possible however some parameters have no C equivalent and
thus a language specific method is used. For example unbounded
arrays are passed as a @code{struct void *address, unsigned int high}
and the contents of these arrays are copied by callee functions
when they are declared as non @code{VAR} parameters.
The @code{VAR} equivalent unbounded array parameters need no copy,
but still use the @code{struct} representation.

The recommended method of interfacing GNU Modula-2 to C is by telling
the definition module that the implmentation is in the C language.
This is achieved by using the keywords @code{DEFINITION MODULE FOR C}.
For example:

@example
DEFINITION MODULE FOR C libc ;

FROM SYSTEM IMPORT ADDRESS ;
EXPORT UNQUALIFIED read, printf ;

PROCEDURE read (d: INTEGER; buf: ADDRESS; nbytes: INTEGER) : INTEGER ;
PROCEDURE printf (a: ARRAY OF CHAR; ...) ;

END libc.
@end example

the @code{UNQUALIFIED} keyword in the definition module informs
GNU Modula-2 not to prefix the module name to exported references
in the object file.

The @code{printf} declaration states that the first parameter semantically
matches @code{ARRAY OF CHAR} but since the module is for the C language
it will be mapped onto @code{char *}. The token @code{...} indicates
a variable number of arguments (varargs) and all parameters passed
here are mapped onto the Modula-2 type @code{WORD}.

(--fixme--) include a short example of a user program using printf and
give an exact compile/link command.

@node Assembly language, , Interface to C, Using
@section Interface to assembly language

The interface for GNU Modula-2 to assembly language is almost identical to GNU C.
The only alterations are that the keywords asm and volatile are in capitals,
following the Modula-2 convention.

A simple, but highly non optimal, example is given below. Here we want to add the
two @code{CARDINAL}s @code{foo} and @code{bar} together and return the result.

@example
PROCEDURE Example (foo, bar: CARDINAL) : CARDINAL ;
VAR
   myout: CARDINAL ;
BEGIN
   ASM VOLATILE ("movl %1,%%eax; addl %2,%%eax; movl %%eax,%0"
      : "=g" (myout)           (* outputs *)
      : "g" (foo), "g" (bar)   (* inputs  *)
      : "eax") ;               (* we trash *)
   RETURN( myout )
END Example ;
@end example

For a full description of this interface we refer the reader to the GNU C manual.

@node History, Overview, , Internals
@section History

The Modula-2 compiler sources have come from the m2f compiler which
runs under GNU/Linux. The original m2f compiler was written in Modula-2
and was bootstrapped via a modified version of p2c 1.20. The m2f
compiler was a recursive descent which generated quadruples as
intermediate code. It also used C style calling convention wherever
possible and utilized a C structure for dynamic arrays.

@node Overview, Integrating, History, Internals
@section Overview

GNU Modula-2 uses flex and a machine generated recursive descent
parser. Most of the source code is written in Modula-2 and
bootstrapping is achieved via a modified version of p2c-1.20.
The modified p2c-1.20 is contained in the GNU Modula-2 source
tree as are a number of other tools necessary for bootstrapping.

@node Integrating, Building, Overview, Internals
@section How the front end integrates with gcc

The M2Base and M2System
modules contain base types and system types respectively they
map onto GCC backend data types.

@node Building, Future, Integrating, Internals
@section Building

The GNU Modula-2 source tree should be unpacked in the GNU GCC
source tree directory @file{gcc-version/gcc}. Typically this
is achieved by the commands:

@example
cd gcc-version/gcc
tar zxf gm2-version.tar.gz
cd ../..
@end example

GNU Modula-2 can be built by typing:

@example
cd gcc-version
./configure
make
@end example

@node Future, Done list, Practicalities, Internals
@section A future wish list

In the future it might be sensible to rewrite M2Quads.mod to
directly call gcc routines, rather than generate quadruples.
However this is a large alteration and I'd firstly like to
see gm2 working with the method outlined above, which is
conceptually easier.

@node Done list, To do list, Future, Internals
@section Done list

What has been done:

@itemize @bullet
@item
the sources to m2f and gcc compile and link to produce cc1gm2.
Compiler will bootstrap itself and three generations of the
compiler all produce the same code.

@item
the back end will generate code and assembly declarations for
modules containing global variables of all types. Procedure
prologue/epilogue is created.

@item
all loop constructs, if then else, case statements and expressions.

@item
nested module initialization.

@item
pointers, arrays, procedure calls, nested procedures.

@item
front end @samp{gm2} can now compile and link modules.

@item
the ability to insert gnu asm statements within GNU Modula-2.

@item
inbuilt functions, SIZE, ADR, TSIZE, HIGH etc

@item
block becomes and complex procedure parameters (unbounded arrays, strings).

@item
the front end now utilizes GCC tree constants and types and is no
longer tied to a 32 bit architecture, but reflects the 'configure'
target machine description.

@item
fixed all C compiler warnings when gcc compiles the p2c generated C
with -Wall.

@item
built a new parser which implements error recovery.

@item
added mechanism to invoke cpp to support conditional compilation if required.

@item
all @samp{Makefile}s are generated via @samp{./configure}

@end itemize

Nearly all the to do work is concerned with interfacing m2f with
gcc and most of this work is localized in the following files:

@file{gm2/gm2.c}
@file{gm2/gccgm2.def}
@file{gm2/m2/comp/gm2s/gcc/M2GenGCC.mod}
@file{gm2/m2/comp/gm2s/gcc/M2GCCDeclare.mod}

@node To do list, , Done list, Internals
@section To do list

What needs to be done:

@itemize @bullet

@item
rewrite documentation.

@item
profile compiler and improve compilation speed.
Compiling @file{P1SyntaxCheck.mod} takes far too long.

@item
the modula-2 front end needs to convert the quadruples into
trees and the convert these trees into gcc trees, rather than
simply translating each quadruple into a separate gcc tree.
The later works but better code could be generated by
building a large tree and passing this tree to gcc.
One way to implement this is by taking a copy of M2SubExp.mod and
basing the gcc calls on the tree structure that M2SubExp.mod builds.
My belief is that this should not take much time to complete and
should produce better code.

This requires separating the semantic checking routines away from M2Quads.mod.
Propose a new module M2Tree which contains the functionality of M2Quads/M2SubExp.
We should be able to remove M2Quads, M2SubExp, M2Optimize, M2GenGCC, M2EvalSym
once this is complete.

SymbolTable needs to be modified.

@item
interfacing to C, we need to introduce DEFINITION MODULE FOR C libc ;
which will allow printf (s: ARRAY OF CHAR; ...);
ARRAY OF CHAR is treated as char * in this module. Any item passed
to a vararg needs to be cast to a WORD.

@item
investigate the use of collect2 during link/module initialization.

@item
utilize GNU autoconf rather than the makeconfigure script.

@item
integrate the small testsuite (gm2/m2/comp/autotest)
into dejagnu ?? and improve

@item
Coroutines - as mentioned by readers of comp.lang.modula2.

@item
improve documentation, specifically this document which should
also include a synopsis of 2nd Edition Modula-2.

@item
testing and fixing bugs
