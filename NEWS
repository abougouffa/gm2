This file describes recent user-visible changes in gm2.  Bug fixes are not
described.  There are more details in the man and info pages.

VERSION 0.50
============

* all regression tests pass on LP64 and i386 GNU/Linux, i386, Mac OS X.3 G5

* gm2-harness 0.7 will download, patch and build gcc, gdb, gm2 with the
  SET and TYPE enhancements below. gm2-harness-0.7 also honours the
   --prefix= option.

* Much better dwarf-2 debugging support and when used with
  a patched gdb-6.3 the programmer can display RECORDs,
  ARRAYs, SETs, subranges and constant char literals in
  Modula-2 syntax.

* it currently complies with Programming in Modula-2 Edition 2, 3 and 4.
  Users can switch on specific mutually exclusive features by using
  -Wpim or -Wpim2.

* gm2 supports full PIM Modula-2 (except variables located at
  particular addresses).

VERSION 0.49
============

* supports sets of any ordinal size (memory permitting).

* implements ISO Modula-2 SYSTEM which can be switched on via: -Wiso.

* easy interface to C, and varargs can be passed to C routines.

* University of Ulm libraries are installed together with the compiler
  and can be accessed via: -Wlibs=ulm

* some Logitech libraries have been implemented and can be accessed via:
  -Wlibs=logitech

* coroutines have been implemented in the PIM style and these are accessible
  from SYSTEM. A number of supporting libraries (executive and file descriptor
  mapping to interrupt vector libraries are available through the
  -Wlibs=pim-coroutines switch).


VERSION 0.42
============

* MinGW cross compilation port released.
  Please see http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/Glamorgan/gaius/web/gm2-mingw.html
  for building details.

VERSION 0.41
============

* native sparc port passes make gm2.paranoid and make check-gm2

* native i386  port passes make gm2.paranoid and make check-gm2

* passes all 1350 regression tests

* builds with gcc-3.3.2

VERSION 0.40
============

* brought GM2 up to date with gcc-3.3.1

* many, many bug fixes and no patch is now required in the garbage collection
  of gcc-3.3.1

* builds under Redhat 9.0 and Suse 9.0

* added the LONGCARD data type.

* LENGTH is now mapped onto M2RTS.Length if the parameter is not a constant
  at compile time.

* standard procedures can be called inside constant expressions.

* introduced examples/pthread

* introduced a tool, h2def, to aid production of DEFINITION MODULE FOR "C" modules
  from C header files.

* added MathLib0 module, added svga example.

* added access to thirty one gcc built-in functions.


VERSION 0.33
============

* implemented large sets.

* implemented ISO compliant sets.

* when gm2 is invoked with -gstabs a patched gdb will
  display set contents. This also works well with SET OF CHAR.

* definition modules no longer have to explicitly export
  identifiers.

VERSION 0.32
============

* gm2 can be built as a native or as a strongarm cross compiler.

* the C preprocessor can be invoked and it processes both definition and
  implementation modules.

* error reporting understands preprocessed Modula-2 source.
