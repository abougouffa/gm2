*  finish ISO language:
   + add type COMPLEX
   + add multidimensional unbounded arrays
*  finish ISO libraries (processes)
*  port GM2 to the latest version of GCC
   + create branch at gcc.gnu.org and start grafting gm2.
*  complete cygwin port
*  back port gm2 to previous releases of gcc
*  fix bugs in h2def
*  fix bug in varient record found in SysVec.mod
*  fix bug (no export qualified leads to unqualified assembler names)
*  finish documentation (p2, p3, p4 description) and scope behaviour
*  complete implementation of the following Logitech-3.0 libraries:
   Calandar, Chronometer,
   DateFormat, Decimals, Directories, DiskDirectory, FileMessage,
   LogiFile, NumberConversion, Options, Processes, SimpleTerm.

*  implement the following in GCC (two call back mechanisms):
   -  if a tree is reachable (and a runtime error will occur).
      Then the back end should call back the front end to
      issue an appropriate error/warning message.
   -  word type node needs a call back such that
      just before the back end emits this data type
      it can call back to the front end to fix up the
      debugging type.  For example this way we can implement
      set types, which can be treated by gimple as word type
      but just at the end, before the dwarf-2 or whatever
      debugging info is written, it can call back to the
      front end and this can be fixed up.

Improve error messages

*  catch
        IF GetChar()    (* PROCEDURE GetChar () : CHAR *)
        THEN
   in a more friendly way.  
*  catch
        PROCEDURE foo (a: IOChan.ChanId) ;
   (where IOChan has not been imported using a better message).
*  improve absent
        IMPORT IOChan
   (reword the error message)
