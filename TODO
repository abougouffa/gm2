Pre 1.0

*  finish ISO libraries:
*    finish PROCESSES.
*    ensure that PIM SYSTEM.PRIORITY is replaced by
     rtint.PROTECTION
*    finish SEMAPHORES, GeneralUser
*  add data alignment directives to records (Scott)
*  complete implementation of the following Logitech-3.0 libraries:
   Calandar, Chronometer,
   DateFormat, Decimals, Directories, DiskDirectory, FileMessage,
   LogiFile, NumberConversion, Options, Processes, SimpleTerm.
*  if at all possible try and make sure that it builds on OSX.
   (Michael)
*  if at all possible try and make sure that it builds on cygwin
   and make gm2.paranoid also passes on cygwin.  (Christoph)

Post 1.0

*  port GM2 to the latest version of GCC
   + create branch at gcc.gnu.org and start grafting gm2.
*  fix bugs in h2def
*  finish documentation (p2, p3, p4 description) and scope behaviour
*  back port gm2 to previous releases of gcc (maybe)
*  allocation of dynamic arrays (extension using alloca).
*  extend records to allow vla as the final field.

*  implement the following in GCC (two call back mechanisms):
   -  if a tree is reachable (and a runtime error will occur).
      Then the back end should call back the front end to
      issue an appropriate error/warning message.
   -  word type node needs a call back such that
      just before the back end emits this data type
      it can call back to the front end to fix up the
      debugging type.  For example this way we can implement
      set types, which can be treated by gimple as word type
      but just at the end, before the dwarf-2 or whatever
      debugging info is written, it can call back to the
      front end and this can be fixed up.

Improve error messages

*  catch
        IF GetChar()    (* PROCEDURE GetChar () : CHAR *)
        THEN
   in a more friendly way.  
*  catch
        PROCEDURE foo (a: IOChan.ChanId) ;
   (where IOChan has not been imported using a better message).
*  improve absent
        IMPORT IOChan
   (reword the error message)

Fix bugs in error detection

*  ensure that enum1 is not compatible with enum2
   both in assignment and expression
*  ensure that opaque1 is not compatible with opaque2
   both in assignment and expression
*  ensure that cannot INCL(enum1Var, someConst)

Fix syntax error recovery

*  it appears not to insert missing ';'s.

Bugs

*  fix bug in varient record found in SysVec.mod
   - is this still true?
