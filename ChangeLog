	* fixed the $(srcdir) in all Makefile.in's
	* configuring and building gm2 is now recommended

	* finally finished rewrite of a number of key modules
	* Strings.mod used instead of StrLib.mod allowing for
	  dynamic arrays
	* new flex built lexical analyser in use.
	* cpp is run on all definition/implementation modules if
	  -Wcpp is used.

2001-08-01	Gaius Mulley <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* brought gm2 up to date with gcc-3.0
	* fixed opaque handling in the new parser
	* now using new parser by default
	* rewritten NameKey.mod, removing any static limits on array
	sizes by using dynamic data structures throughout.
	* improved p2c so that it handles opaque types properly.
	* modified Lists.def, SymbolKey.def to use opaque types.
	
2001-03-09	Gaius Mulley <gaius@glam.ac.uk>
	
	* fixed bug in FpuIO.mod which failed to issue a '-' when emitting
	  real numbers.
	* added many new tests to the regression directory (autotest).
	* fixed bugs in the bnf descriptions. Compiler is now using
 	  automatically generated parser for P1, P2 and P3. Just PH
 	  remains hand built.
        * Introduced a number of small regression tests following
 	  Olivier's extensive bug report on (m2f). Fixed a number
 	  of bugs reported, see gm2/m2/comp/BUGS for details.
	* Fixed bug in M2Lexical.mod causing mismatch between
 	  source line numbers and gdb information.
        * Fixed + - / of constant sets.
        * removed tests for the interim (they exist under
 	  bitset3.mod.breaks and string.mod.breaks respectively)
        * modifications to stop overflow on max CARDINAL when converting
 	  numbers into strings (NumberIO.mod)

2001-02-28	Gaius Mulley <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* using new parser P1SyntaxCheck.mod and P2Build.mod
	  P1SyntaxCheck.mod now inserts simple missing tokens.
	* both automatically generated and provide better error
	  recovery
	* improved some error messages

2001-01-23	Gaius Mulley <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* brought gm2 up to date with gcc-20001204
	* introduced configure and moved all makefiles to Makefile.in
	* tidied up p2c a little, in an attempt to reduce the compile
 	  time warnings

2000-12-02	Gaius Mulley <gaius@glam.ac.uk>

	* brought gm2 up to date with gcc-20001120
