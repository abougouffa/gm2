(*
   ReadCardinal - read an unsigned decimal number from the terminal.
                  The read continues until a space, newline, esc or
                  end of file is reached.
*)

PROCEDURE ReadCardinal (VAR c: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   WriteCardinal - writes the value, c, to the terminal and ensures
                   that at least, n, characters are written. The number
                   will be padded out by preceeding spaces if necessary.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteCardinal (c: CARDINAL; n: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   ReadHex - reads in an unsigned hexadecimal number from the terminal.
             The read continues until a space, newline, esc or
             end of file is reached.
*)

PROCEDURE ReadHex (VAR c: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   WriteHex - writes out a CARDINAL, c, in hexadecimal format padding
              with, n, characters (leading with '0')

(*
   ReadLongCardinal - read an unsigned decimal number from the terminal.
