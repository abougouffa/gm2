   GetBits - returns the bits firstBit..lastBit from source.
             Bit 0 of word maps onto the firstBit of source.

PROCEDURE GetBits (source: WORD; firstBit, lastBit: CARDINAL) : WORD ;


(*
   SetBits -

PROCEDURE SetBits (VAR word: WORD; firstBit, lastBit: CARDINAL;
                   pattern: WORD) ;


(*
   WordAnd - returns a bitwise (left AND right)
*)

PROCEDURE WordAnd (left, right: WORD) : WORD ;


(*
   WordOr - returns a bitwise (left OR right)
*)

PROCEDURE WordOr (left, right: WORD) : WORD ;


(*
   WordXor - returns a bitwise (left XOR right)
*)

PROCEDURE WordXor (left, right: WORD) : WORD ;


(*
   WordNot - returns a word with all bits inverted.
*)

PROCEDURE WordNot (word: WORD) : WORD ;
