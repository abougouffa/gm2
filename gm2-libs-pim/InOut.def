   OpenInput - reads a string from stdin as the filename for reading.

               extension. The global variable Done is set if all

   OpenOutput - reads a string from stdin as the filename for writing.
                If the filename ends with `.' then it appends the defext

(*
   CloseOutput - closes an opened output file and returns output back to

(*
   Read - reads a single character from the current input file.
          Done is set to FALSE if end of file is reached or an
          error occurs.

(*
   ReadString - reads a sequence of characters. Leading white space

   ReadInt - reads a string and converts it into an INTEGER, x.

(*
   WriteCard - writes the CARDINAL, x, to the output file. It ensures

   WriteOct - writes the CARDINAL, x, to the output file in octal.

              Leading spaces are added if required.
*)

(*
   WriteHex - writes the CARDINAL, x, to the output file in hexadecimal.
