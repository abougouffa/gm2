   ReadReal - reads a real number, legal syntaxes include:
              100, 100.0, 100e0, 100E0, 100E-1, E2, +1E+2, 1e+2

PROCEDURE ReadReal (VAR x: REAL) ;


(*
   WriteReal - writes a real to the terminal. The real number
               is right justified and, n, is the minimum field
               width.
