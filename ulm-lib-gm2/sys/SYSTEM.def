EXPORT QUALIFIED (* the following are built into the compiler: *)
                 ADDRESS, WORD, BYTE, BITSET, ADR, TSIZE, SIZE,
                 (* the rest are implemented in SYSTEM.c *)
                 UNIXCALL, UNIXSIGNAL, UNIXFORK ;


(*
   UNIXCALL - returns TRUE if the syscall was successful, results from
              the system call are returned in r0 and r1.
*)

PROCEDURE UNIXCALL (syscall: CARDINAL; VAR r0, r1: INTEGER; ...) : BOOLEAN;


(*
   UNIXFORK - returns TRUE if successful and pid is set to the son pid
              if the parent is returning. If the child is returning pid=0.
              UNIXFORK returns FALSE if an error occurs and errno is held in pid.
*)

PROCEDURE UNIXFORK (VAR pid: CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   UNIXSIGNAL - 
*)

PROCEDURE UNIXSIGNAL (signo: CARDINAL; p: PROC;
                      VAR old: PROC; VAR result: CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN;


END SYSTEM.
