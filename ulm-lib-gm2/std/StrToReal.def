   Revision 1.2  2004/06/29 08:51:42  gaius
   * made flex lexical analysers ignore carriage return
   * fixed bug in M2Quads.mod checking parameter of
     a const var before value was known.
   * fixed local MODULEs so that they can FROM mod IMPORT
   * tidied up some ulm implementation modules in ulm-lib-gm2/std

   Revision 1.1  2003/12/27 00:16:06  gaius
   added ulm libraries into the gm2 tree. Currently these
   are only used when regression testing, but later they
   will be accessible by users of gm2.
