   Revision 1.5  2005/11/22 15:13:21  gaius
   fixed Copyright dates

   Revision 1.4  2005/11/21 12:09:59  gaius
   updated Copyright notices and dates

   Revision 1.3  2005/05/10 15:24:41  gaius
   Many changes which enable GM2 to compile nested varient records correctly.
   Runtime regression test added to give confidence that this language
   construct is working.
   gm2.texi also contains documentation of the front end symbol table
   representation of the record, varient, and field symbols.
   These changes allow gm2/ulm-lib-gm2/std/RTErrors.mod to compile.
   There are now three outstanding ULM modules which fail to compile.

   Revision 1.2  2004/06/29 08:51:42  gaius
   * made flex lexical analysers ignore carriage return
   * fixed bug in M2Quads.mod checking parameter of
     a const var before value was known.
   * fixed local MODULEs so that they can FROM mod IMPORT
   * tidied up some ulm implementation modules in ulm-lib-gm2/std

   Revision 1.1  2003/12/27 00:16:05  gaius
   added ulm libraries into the gm2 tree. Currently these
   are only used when regression testing, but later they
   will be accessible by users of gm2.

   Revision 0.2  1997/02/28  15:50:22  borchert
   header fixed

   Revision 0.1  1997/02/21  19:18:08  borchert
