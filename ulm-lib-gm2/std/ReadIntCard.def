   Revision 1.4  2005/11/21 12:09:59  gaius
   updated Copyright notices and dates

   Revision 1.3  2004/08/26 19:08:07  gaius
   * implemented type PROCESS for SYSTEM in the pim library
     directory (gm2/gm2-libs-coroutines).
   * SYSTEM implements NEWPROCESS, TRANSFER, IOTRANSFER.
     This is achieved by using the GNU pthread library context
     mechanism.
   * provided an Executive and TimerHandler module in
     (gm2/examples/executive).
   * many bug fixes and regression tests show that 3 ulm standard
     library modules fail.
   * implemented MAX(REAL), MIN(REAL) and also provided access to
     three more gcc builtin functions: huge_val, huge_vall, huge_valf
   * started work on a Logitech 3.0 compatible library.

   Revision 1.2  2004/06/29 08:51:42  gaius
   * made flex lexical analysers ignore carriage return
   * fixed bug in M2Quads.mod checking parameter of
     a const var before value was known.
   * fixed local MODULEs so that they can FROM mod IMPORT
   * tidied up some ulm implementation modules in ulm-lib-gm2/std

   Revision 1.1  2003/12/27 00:16:05  gaius
   added ulm libraries into the gm2 tree. Currently these
   are only used when regression testing, but later they
   will be accessible by users of gm2.
