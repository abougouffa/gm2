   $Log: RandomGenerator.def,v $
   Revision 1.1  2004/05/05 21:34:58  gaius
   * added SHIFT and ROTATE into ISO SYSTEM and
     made the compiler shift and rotate word and multi-word
     set types. Multi-word set rotate and shifts are implemented
     by calling ISO SYSTEM runtime procedures. Word sized sets or
     smaller are implemented inline using shift/rotate instructions.
     Currently not yet debugged, but mostly complete code.

   * fixed bug report by Paul Whittington <pwhittington@nitrodata.com>
     (see testsuite/gm2/link/pim/fail/import.mod).

   * updated gm2.texi to reflect new options and changes to the
     run-time system.

   * introduced -Wunbounded-by-reference option which will make a
     reference to non VAR unbounded data providing it is not written to
     within the callee procedure.
   * introduced -Wverbose-unbounded option which displays names of
     unbounded parameters which the compiler will implement as
     references even though they were specified as non VAR parameters.

   * introduced -Wcase, -Wnil runtime checks
   * introduced -Wcheck-all to enable all runtime flags
   * updated documentation to refect new options

   Revision 1.1  2003/12/27 00:16:05  gaius
   added ulm libraries into the gm2 tree. Currently these
   are only used when regression testing, but later they
   will be accessible by users of gm2.
