This directory contains the ISO definition modules and some
corresponding implementation modules. All definition files except
@file{M2RTS.def} were defined by the International Standard
Information technology - programming languages BS ISO/IEC
10514-1:1996E Part 1: Modula-2, Base Language.  The Copyright to the
definition files (except M2RTS.def) belong to ISO/IEC (International
Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical
Commission).  However the implementation modules and M2RTS.def are
Copyright of the FSF and are held under the LGPL.

The definition modules are allowed to be distributed together with
the compiler.

Currently this is work in progress and the code is incomplete and
probably highly buggy.

The following implementation modules are complete:
@code{ChanConsts}
@code{CharClass}
@code{ConvTypes}
@code{Strings}
@code{TERMINATION} and
@code{M2RTS}.
