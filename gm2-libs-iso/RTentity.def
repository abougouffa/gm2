    Title      : RTentity

    Revision   : $Version$ 
    Description: provides a set of routines for maintaining an
                 efficient mechanism to group opaque (or pointer)
                 data structures together.  Internally the
                 entities are grouped together using a binary
                 tree.  It does not use Storage - and instead
                 uses malloc, free from libc as Storage uses the
                 module to detect erroneous deallocations.
