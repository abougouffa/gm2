    Title      : ErrnoCategory

    Revision   : $Version$ 
    Description: provides an interface to errno (if the system
                 supports it) which determines whether the current
                 errno is a hard or soft error.  These distinctions
                 are needed by the ISO Modula-2 libraries.  Not all
                 errno values are tested, only those which could be
                 related to a device.

(*
   IsErrnoHard - returns TRUE if the value of errno is associated with
                 a hard device error.
*)

PROCEDURE IsErrnoHard (e: INTEGER) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   IsErrnoSoft - returns TRUE if the value of errno is associated with
                 a soft device error.
*)

PROCEDURE IsErrnoSoft (e: INTEGER) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   UnAvailable - returns TRUE if the value of errno indicates that
                 the resource or device is unavailable for some
                 reason.

PROCEDURE UnAvailable (e: INTEGER) : BOOLEAN ;


END ErrnoCategory.
